# :shield: AutoBackup Monitoring
<p>

In the current context of my country, I felt the need to constantly monitor the files being edited on the PC, as these can be corrupted or lost due to power outages, in addition to the lack of backup power equipment.

# How does it work?
It constantly monitors the modification of the files being worked on. If a power outage occurs, a history of saved files recorded with the date and time of the files will be available.
